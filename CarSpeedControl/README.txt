This script adds a configurable speed limiter based on vehicle spawn names.
It supports both default GTA vehicles and custom add-on cars. 



Features:  - Works client-side
           - Supports custom (add-on) vehicles
           - Set different speed limits per vehicle model


If you want to add a vehicle to the config.lua, make sure to enable the debug function.
Then, sit inside the vehicle and check the F8 console to see the correct spawn name.
Use that name in the config to set the speed limit.
